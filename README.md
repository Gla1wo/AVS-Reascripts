# Andrew Scott's ReaScripts for [Reaper](https://www.reaper.fm/)

These scripts were written to add additional functionality to the digital audio workstation REAPER. As a sound designer with a concentration on audio for games, most of these scripts are tailored specifically towards a game audio workflow. If you'd like to check out some of the projects I've been working on lately, take a look at [my website](https://www.andrewvscott.com/).

All of the scripts in this repository can be imported directly in Reaper by using the [ReaPack REAPER extension](https://reapack.com/), the free scripts/packages download manager made by cfillion. I strongly recommend setting up ReaPack to install and use these scripts.

# ReaPack Installation
